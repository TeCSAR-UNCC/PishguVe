# PishguVe: Attention-utilizing Graph Isomorphism and CNN based Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Architecture


This repository contains official Pytorch impleoemntaion of PishguVe, a novel lightweight vehicle trajectory prediction deep learning architecture that uses attention-based graph isomorphism and convolutional neural networks. 

## Domains and Datasets
- Bird's-eye View: NGSIM Dataset
- Eye-level View: [Carolians Highway dataset](https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Carolinas_Dataset)
- High-angle View: [Carolians Highway dataset](https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Carolinas_Dataset)

## Installation 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/PishguVe.git
cd PishguVe
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

## Training and Testing
For training and saving the model in the Training section just set the "save_model" and "train" fields to True in the config file and use the following command:
```
python3 main.py --config {path_to_the_config_file}
```

For testing, just give the path to desired model in the config file and set "save_model" and "train" fields to False and use the same command:
```
python3 main.py --config {path_to_the_config_file}
```
